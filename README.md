# ASTR260_HW10

Problem 1: I did not make it very far on this. I got stuck and then just tried to focus on problem 2... Which I also did not do so well on. Its not even worth running AidanWalk_HW10_1.py, it doesnt do anything.

Problem 2: run AidanWalk_HW10_2 by executing python AidanWalk_HW10_2.py. This will calculate two orbits for a comet using RK4 fixed step size. I could not get the adaptive step size to work. When ran, it will print out all of my answers for part b of this problem.
